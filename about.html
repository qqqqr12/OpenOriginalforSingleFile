<h1>Open Original for SingleFile 0.2</h1>
<h2>Thank you for installing this extension!</h2>

<h2>Short description</h2>
<p>This extension helps opening the original url of a page saved with SingleFile extension.</p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle">SingleFile</a>
is an excellent third-party extension which allows you to archive a complete webpage into a single HTML file.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when viewing such an archive, there is no easy way to reopen the original page (e.g. to check whether
it has been updated since then).</p>
<p>This extension aims at filling this gap by displaying an icon in the Omnibox (next to the favorite icon),
which allows with a single click to reopen the original page saved with SinglePage.</p>
<h2>Install instruction</h2>
<p>To complete installation, do not forget to open the <a id="ext" href="#">Extension Manager</a>
and to allow the extension to have access to file URL, by selecting the appropriate option as shown below :</p>
<p><img src="install_screenshot.jpg"></p>
<p>Otherwise, the extension would not be allowed to analyse your files saved with SingleFile.</p>
